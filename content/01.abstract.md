## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The age of abundant data has arrived.
As the costs to generate and distribute omics-scale data have plummeted in the last two decades, previously impossible analysis is now reality.
Through the integration of many types of omics data, diseases can increasingly be understood on their own terms: as highly complex, self-interacting, nonlinear biological systems.
This review seeks to describe some of the many promising methods to simultaneously leverage multiple data modalities.
Specifically, we examine the application of network methods as powerful, extensible, and natural ways to deal with multiple streams of information about a large number of entities.
Significant progress has been made in the past two decades in unsupervised methods for data integration.
While unsupervised methods can be extremely beneficial to supervised analyses, such applications remain an area of active and vibrant research.
We conclude the review by exploring some of the potential avenues for future research and discovery.
