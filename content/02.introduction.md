## Introduction

<!--
    Why be doing this omics stuff at all
    * Personalized and precision medicine
    * Clinical AND molecular patient profiles drive diagnosis and treatment
    * Establish homogeneous subtypes to overcome the heterogeneity in biomarkers and response to treatment

### Omics and precision medicine

Precision medicine entails custom-tailoring health care to individual patients based on their personal, clinical, and molecular profiles.
The goal of precision medicine is to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment by accounting for the medically-relevant differences between individuals and groups.
Toward this goal, the clinical value of omics data and omics-based discoveries has been demonstrated repeatedly.
A brief overview of some sub-fields illustrates the possibilities for future research and the potential value of these discoveries.

Pharmacogenomics studies the genomic underpinnings of individual differences in drug response.
As of August 2018, the FDA lists <https://www.fda.gov/drugs/scienceresearch/ucm572698.htm> drugs with pharmacogenomic information included on the label [@url:https://www.fda.gov/drugs/scienceresearch/ucm572698.htm].

    Why multi-omics over single-omics
    * It's more desirable for reasons of performance
    * It has become significantly cheaper over the past {timeframe: years? decade?}

### Multiomics

While the clinical application of genomic data shows promise, biology cannot be fully explained by a single data type.
Many diseases are affected in part by patients' genomic profiles, though few diseases are based soley in genetics.
The central dogma of molecular biology states that genetic information flows from nucleic acid to nucleic acid and from nucleic acid to protein.
This information alone suggests that processes and information beyond the genetic sequence of a patient's DNA will influence phenotype.
_Multiomics_ refers to the set of such biologically-relevant molecular data sources: genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and the organismal microbiome.
Complex diseases may be most explainable when viewed through multiple such data lenses.

In recent years, the cost of omics data generation has fallen dramatically.
A former target of $1,000 per genome sequenced now seems high as companies like Illumina promise a future of the, "$100 genome," [@url:https://ft.com/content/017a3a50-f6f1-11e7-a4c9-bbdefa4f210b].
Such rapid technological improvements have made the creation of large-scale multiomic datasets cost-effective.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a large-scale project which has collected patient information and tumor samples from over 11,000 patients in the United States.
Its data include clinical information about patients, sample metadata, and multiomic sample data including gene expression, SNP genotypes, copy number variation, DNA methylation, exon sequencing, and microRNA profiles [@doi:10.1038/ng.2764].
Another project underway is the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), which seeks to incorporate data from TCGA and around 50 other projects to provide researchers access to a massive quantity of tumor omics data [@doi:10.1038/nature08987].

    Why data-integrative methods
    * Allows discovery of nonlinear relationships
    * This way, should be able to avoid plummeting signal-to-noise ratio

### Data integration

Different data modalities can contain distinct pieces of medically-relevant information.
This has led researchers and clinicians to consider how multiple data modalities can together provide a more complete picture of disease.
An obvious approach for prediction or classification is the simple combination (or concatenation) of data from multiple modalities.
The issue with such approaches has to do with the data themselves.
Omics data often contain a very large number of features relative to the number of samples.
This leads to a low signal-to-noise ratio, which is only worsened by the concatenation of data from two or more different streams.
