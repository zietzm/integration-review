Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a method due to Wang, et al. [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.2810], uses patient similarity networks to cluster patients and predict future labels.
In these networks, nodes represent patients and the edges connecting patients represent their pairwise similarity.
For each additional data modality, SNF creates a similarity network based on the patients' molecular profiles.
The constructed modality-specific networks are then fused using an iterative linear algebra routine which is appropriate for studies of varied sample size and feature number, as well as for highly heterogeneous data sources.
The authors applied SNF to three data modalities for a case study of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor which is challenging to treat [@url:https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Glioblastoma-Multiforme].
Previous data-integrative approaches had shown varied results, including the identification of a variable numbers of disease subtypes, depending on the data modality under investigation.
Using SNF, the authors were able to recover known clinically-relevant disease subtypes and show that these subtypes correspond to very different survival prognoses.
Moreover, by probing the network resulting from the SNF method, the authors were able to show that the majority of the edges were supported by two or more different data modalities.
